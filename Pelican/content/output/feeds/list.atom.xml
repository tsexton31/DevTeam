that's just not possible because the game you enjoy is overrun by individuals who seem to be running around 
with 2 working braincells, making the game unplayable for others. Here are my top 3 games that reverses the role 
and plays with MY emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Us: This 2018 indie party game starting gaining groud due to people looking for ways to hang out and play 
something with friends in these quarantining times. The game is loosely based on the classic card/story game, Mafia, 
where there is a group of civilians with an imposter among them who's only goal is to deceive, sabotage, and kill their 
way to victory. This game brings out the worst in every friend group, testing the limits of trust among the suspicious. 
Personally, being the amazing detective I am, makes me the top target in every game where the imposter wants to shut me 
down or the crew is convinced I am the silver tounged bandit trying to weasel my way through the system. Either way, being 
good at the game just causes you to play it even less, putting it at my number 3 spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: This game is your staple yearly first person shooter game that mostly every gamer is seasoned 
to buy no matter how much they deny liking the franchise. The fps player base has been conditioned from a young age to buy into 
they yearly hype and massive online community that is Call of Duty. From the young pre-teens screaming profanities to the more 
seasoned veterans, everyone is either dubbed trash or a tryhard in this game. You will almost always get ridiculed for either being 
an absolute noob or having a killstreak of 50-3, enraging both teammates and opponents alike. Regardless of this being the case, 
the handy excuse of "the host connection is garbage" or "my team sucks" will always shine in games like this, thus putting it at my 
number 2 spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall Guys: Currently in the gaming landscape, battle royales are all the rage. Starting with the well known titles of PUBG and 
Fortnite, almost every big developer has tried their hand at either a massive battle royale standalone or a mode within thier 
popular titles. Fall Guys took the world by storm a few weeks ago upon release by straying from the typical shooter style battle royale. 
Their take? Run around as jelly beans and complete obstacle courses. This led the way to major shenanigans throughout the game but 
with every multiplayer game comes THE TROLLS. In every 60 player lobby, there is guarenteed to be at least 20 players who don't care 
about winning and only want to watch everyone else suffer. The amount of times I have almost won but got stopped because a bean with 
a french fry suit grabbed me and tossed me off a ledge (and totally not because I'm just bad) is high in the triple digits. As fun 
of a game this might be, the player base will find every possible way to make you see red, thus putting it at my top spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
